### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lucas Coffey,

A Cloud Native-Applications Developer, particularly on AWS. 

- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I am a Veteran of the Kentucky Air National Guard. I was a part-time Crew Chief on C-130H while attending flight school to become a Commercial Pilot.
- :bulb: I'm interested in all things Cloud: Cloud Architecture, Cloud Engineering and building Cloud-Native Web Applications & Web Development.  
- ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about Aviation, JavaScript, NodeJS, React, Next.js, NextJS, Python College Football or anything that interests you.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing the AWS SysOps and trying to get better at programming after a year off due to COVID.
