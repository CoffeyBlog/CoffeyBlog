### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lucas Coffey, 

an AWS Cloud Engineer interested in Data, ML and Data Vizualization. 

- âš¡ **Fun fact:** I am a Veteran of the Kentucky Air National Guard. I was a part-time Crew Chief on C-130H while attending flight school to become a Commercial Pilot.
- :bulb: I'm interested in all things Cloud: Cloud Architecture, Cloud Engineering and building Cloud-Native Web Applications & Web Development.  
- ðŸ’¬ Talk to me about Aviation, Python, College Football or anything that interests you.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently pursuing the AWS Developer Cert and trying to get better at programming after a year off due to COVID.
